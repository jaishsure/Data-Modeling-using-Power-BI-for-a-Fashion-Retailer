Title: Data Modeling for a Fashion Retailer using Power BI

Description:

This repository showcases a Power BI data modeling project for analyzing customer order data from Dane Chic Mode, a fashion retailer. The project involves:

Data exploration and modeling: Identifying facts and dimensions within the dataset, and structuring them into one Fact Table and five Dimension Tables (Customer, Product, Location, Ship Mode, Ship Date).
Star schema development: Building a well-defined star schema in Power BI with optimized relationships between the Fact Table and each Dimension Table.
Granular join implementation: Utilizing specific columns like postal code (Location) to enable detailed analysis at individual location levels.
Dimension table optimization: Creating indexes on appropriate columns within each Dimension Table for efficient data retrieval.

Enhanced data organization and accessibility for reporting and analysis.
Faster query execution and improved performance.
Foundation for in-depth insights into customer behavior and sales trends.
